The GUI is intended as a launcher for Kilosort, to help you run it on your data without errors and to do some sanity checks that it is working properly. It does NOT include any functionality for manually curating/revising/editing the results of the algorithm, so it is not a replacement for Phy or for other careful manual inspection.
